        Below this comment, add a list of URLs where users have existing
        subscriptions, with the path to the remote helper frame file.

        Any origin belonging to onesignal.com or os.tc should use the following
        format to the remote helper file:

        - (for subdomain.onesignal.com)
          https://your-old-subdomain.onesignal.com/amp/remote_frame?appId=YOUR-APP-ID
        - (for subdomain.os.tc)
          https://your-old-subdomain.os.tc/amp/remote_frame?appId=YOUR-APP-ID

        Don't forget to replace YOUR-APP-ID with your actual app ID.

        By this point in the AMP setup, you should have already:

        a) Downloaded a remote "amp-http-remote-frame.js" file

        b) Created a "remote_frame.html" file that includes the
        "amp-http-remote-frame.js" script

        c) Uploaded this "remote_frame.html" to each of the URLs where users
        have existing subscriptions

        ----------------

        Note 1: Do not include the main site where new users are getting
        subscribed. This list should only include:

        a) Sites that have existing subscriptions

        b) Sites that are being used as a OneSignal app

        Note 2: A couple examples are below. If they don't apply, remove them.
